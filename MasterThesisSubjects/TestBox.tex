The CMS experiment is a particle-physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's most powerful particle accelerator. During the last 20 years, LHC and CMS were constructed in worldwide collaborations at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, CERN, close to Geneva, Switzerland.
There are several thesissubjects available to work with the Gent CMS-group on analyses of the data. In particular the group focusses on precision studies of properties of the top-quark, and on direct searches for new physics like SuperSymmetry. In each case there will be direct interaction with a supervisor in Gent, but also with the Gent group members based at CERN. A stay of several weeks at CERN (or a few shorter visits) is usually a part of the thesis work.        \end{minipage}
