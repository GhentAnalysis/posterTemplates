          The Ghent CMS team is involved in several analyses at CMS, which include supersymmetry searches and top quark physics, and plans to search for Heavy Majorana neutrinos.
          Master students are welcome to join in one of our analyses groups where they get the opportunity to explore the large amounts of new data.
          Under the daily supervision of our CMS team, you will acquire the necessary knowledge to identify physics objects, select the events of interest and to use big data analysis techniques.
          You get the opportunity to gain experience in an international collaboration, and present/discuss results at CERN.
